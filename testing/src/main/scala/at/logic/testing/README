The file testing.scala in this directory contains some sequences of example proofs.
They have been formalised for the purpose of testing cut-introduction.

- LinearExampleProof
  Expected compression ratio:
    1 Pi_1-cut (1 quantifier):   n -> sqrt(n)
    Pi_1-cuts (1 quantifier):    n -> log(n)

- SquareDiagonalExampleProof
  Expected compression ratio:
    1 Pi_1-cut (1 quantifier):   n -> sqrt(n)
    Pi_1-cuts (1 quantifier):    n -> log(n)

- SquareEdgesExampleProof
  Expected compression ratio:
    1 Pi_1-cut (1 quantifier):   2n -> n + sqrt(n)
    2 Pi_1-cuts (1 quantifier):  2n -> 2sqrt(n)
    Pi_1-cuts (1 quantifier):    2n -> 2log(n)

- SumExampleProof
  Expected compression ratio:
    Pi_1-cuts (1 quantifier):    n -> n
    Pi_1-cuts (2 quantifiers):   n -> log(n)
