 * Class for convenient construction of proofs.
 * Allows you to write proofs post-order style (Ã  la Bussproofs). Example:

 * (ProofBuilder
 * c LogicalAxiom(A)
 * c LogicalAxiom(B)
 * u (WeakeningLeftRule(_, C))
 * b (AndRightRule(_,_, And(A, B))
 * qed)

 * The constructor is private, so the only way to instantiate this class is by using the ProofBuilder object.
 * This means that the stack will always be empty in the beginning.
